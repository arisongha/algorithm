# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

- Example:

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

- Note:

  - There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
  - Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.

**Follow up**: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## My Result

Wrong Answer

## TODO

모든 조합을 생각하지 못했다. 그리고 n log n 의 시간복잡도도 마찬가지.
