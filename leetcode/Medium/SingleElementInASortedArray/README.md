# Single Element in a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

- Example 1:

```
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```

- Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
