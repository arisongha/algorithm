# Single Number II

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

- Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

- Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

## My Result

**Runtime** : 1120 ms, faster than 5.09% of Python3 online submissions for Single Number II.

**Memory Usage** : 13.9 MB, less than 40.40% of Python3 online submissions for Single Number II.

## TODO

- Algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
