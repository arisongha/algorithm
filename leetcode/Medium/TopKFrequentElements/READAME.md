# Top K Frequent Elements

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

- Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

- Note:

  - You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
  - Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
