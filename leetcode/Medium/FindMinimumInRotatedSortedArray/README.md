# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
Find the minimum element.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

- Example 1:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
