# Shortest Distance to a Character

Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

- Example 1:

```
Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
``` 

- Note:

  - `S` string length is in `[1, 10000]`.
  - `C` is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string `S`.
  - All letters in `S` and `C` are lowercase.
