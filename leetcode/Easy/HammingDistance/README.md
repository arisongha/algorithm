# Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

- Note:

`0 ≤ x, y < 231`.

- Example:

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
```

- The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
