# Rotate String

We are given two strings, A and B.
A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

- Example 1:

> `Input`: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
`Output`: true

- Example 2:

> `Input`: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
`Output`: false

- Note:

A and B will have length at most 100.
