# Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

- Example 1:

> `Input`: s = "egg", t = "add"
`Output`: true

- Example 2:

> `Input`: s = "foo", t = "bar"
`Output`: false

- Example 3:

> `Input`: s = "paper", t = "title"
`Output`: true

- Note:

You may assume both s and t have the same length.
