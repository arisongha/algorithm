# Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

- Example 1:

> `Input`: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
`Output`: true

- Example 2:

> `Input`:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
`Output`: false

- Example 3:

> `Input`: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
`Output`: false

- Example 4:

> `Input`: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
`Output`: false
