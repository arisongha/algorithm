# Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Note**:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

- Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## My Result

**Runtime** : 52 ms, faster than 37.30% of Python3 online submissions for Single Number.

**Memory Usage** : 15.1 MB, less than 5.05% of Python3 online submissions for Single Number.

## TODO

without using extra memory
