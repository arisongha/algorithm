# Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.
A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

 
- Example 1:

```
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

- Constraints:

  - The given address is a valid IPv4 address.
