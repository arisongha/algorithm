# Power of Four

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

- Example 1:

```
Input: 16
Output: true
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: 5
Output: false
```

**Follow up** : Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## My Result

**Runtime** : 40 ms, faster than 99.88% of Python3 online submissions for Power of Four.

**Memory Usage** : 13.2 MB, less than 5.63% of Python3 online submissions for Power of Four.

## TODO

- loops/recursion 없이?
